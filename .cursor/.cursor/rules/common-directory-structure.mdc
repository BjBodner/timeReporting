# Rule: common-directory-structure (Cursor)

Self-contained rule; supersedes the older `dir-structure` guidance.

## Top-level files
- `.env`: environment variables sourced at startup (if needed).
- `run.sh`: simple shell script to run the project (if applicable).
- `config.json`: user configuration for the program (if applicable).

## Standard directories
- `docs/`: project documentation and readme-style markdown.
- `aws-deployment/`: AWS setup/deploy assets (e.g., eventbridge, iam-*, setup guides).
- `data/`: databases, runtime files, persistence.
- `src/`: source code (see component layout below).
- `log/`: logs.

## Component layout inside `src/`
If the project has multiple functions/components (e.g., web frontend, web backend, scraper, LLM service), place each under its own directory:
- `src/web-fe/`
- `src/web-be/`
- `src/scraper/`
- `src/llm/`
- ...etc.

This keeps navigation clear and makes it easy to find each component.

## Guidance
- Only create files/directories when needed by the project.
- Keep tool-specific items in their respective `.cursor/`, `.claude/`, `.vscode/` folders when applicable.
- This rule supersedes the older `dir-structure` guidance.
