# Rule: documentation (Cursor)

Self-contained rule; defines documentation standards for projects.

## Location and format

- All documentation must be stored under `[project-root]/docs/`.
- All documentation files must use the `*.md` (Markdown) format.

## Required documentation

Every project must include:

- **High-level design/planning document**: A planning or design document that provides an overview of the project, its architecture, goals, and current state. This document should be updated as the project evolves.
- **`quick-start.md`**: A guide explaining how to install and run the project locally on both Linux and Windows environments. Include prerequisites, installation steps, configuration, and how to verify the setup works.

## Feature documentation

When developing new features:

- **Planning document**: Each new feature must be added to the planning document with its current status (e.g., planned, in-progress, completed).
- **Feature documentation file**: Each feature must have its own documentation file named `feature-[feature-name].md` in the `docs/` directory. This file should describe what the feature does, how it works (high-level), how to use it, any configuration or dependencies required, and examples if applicable.

## Maintenance

- Update the planning document when feature status changes.
- Keep feature documentation files current as features evolve.
- Update `quick-start.md` when installation or setup requirements change.

## Guidance

- Documentation should be clear, concise, and focused on helping developers understand and work with the project.
- Use consistent formatting and structure across all documentation files.
- Link between related documentation files when helpful.
- Keep documentation close to the code it describes (in `docs/` at project root).

## Out of scope

- API documentation generated from code annotations (handled separately if needed).
- Inline code comments (covered by code style guidelines).
- README.md at project root (may follow different conventions).
- Auto-generated documentation from code.
